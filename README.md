### Manual Setup

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install
```
Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
